# Portfolio - Certifications Section Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to add a new "Certifications" section to their portfolio website that follows the same format and styling as the existing Education section. This will allow them to showcase their professional certifications and credentials in a consistent manner with the rest of the portfolio.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Consistency**: The new Certifications section must match the exact styling and layout of the Education section
2. **Data Structure**: Need to define a proper data structure for certifications in the config file
3. **Component Integration**: The new component needs to be properly imported and placed in the correct order
4. **Responsive Design**: Must maintain the same responsive behavior as the Education section
